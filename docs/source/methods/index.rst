      - Calculate pedestrian flow characteristics using trajectory data, following the methodology in
        `Continuity equation and fundamental diagram of pedestrians <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11857>`_.
        This approach ensures consistency with the continuity equation when analyzing movement patterns
        along measurement lines.
