      - Compute the Fundamental Diagram using the framework introduced in the paper
        `[Continuity equation and fundamental diagram of pedestrians](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11857)`.
        This method defines density, speed, and flow based on pedestrian trajectories, ensuring consistency
        with the continuity equation when analyzing pedestrian movement along a measurement line.
