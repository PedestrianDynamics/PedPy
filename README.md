# Pedestrian-Trajectory-Analyzer (PiTA)

`PiTA` is a python library to analyze pedestrian trajectories.
It implements different measurement methods for density, velocity and flow.

`PiTA` offers various useful ploting features e.g. density/velocity profiles,
fundamental diagrams, N-T-diagrams, etc.

## Getting started

### Setup dependencies

For setting up your Python Environment a Python version >= 3.8 is recommended.
To avoid conflicts with other libraries/applications the usage of virtual
environments is recommended, see
[Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
for more detail.

To install the requirements use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to use

The usage of `PiTA` is demonstrated in the [demo notebook](usage.ipynb).
