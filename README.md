# jpsreport-python

`JPSreport` is a command line module to analyze trajectories of pedestrians.

This repo is a port from the original `JPSreport` to a Python implementation, and will provide the same functionalities

## Getting started
### Setup dependencies
For setting up your Python Environment a Python version >= 3.8 is recommended (our code is tested with 3.8).
To avoid conflicts with other libraries/applications the usage of virtual environments is recommended, see [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more detail.

Now the needed libraries for `JPSreport` need to be installed.
You can use the provided `requirements.txt` to do so:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
After installing all dependencies `JPSreport` can be used with:

```bash
python jpsreport.py <path-to-inifile> [-v] 
```

For setting the verbosity level, use `-v` for info messages, `-vv` for debug and `-vvv` for everything
