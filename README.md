# Pedestrian-Trajectory-Analyzer (PiTA)

`PiTA` is a python library to analyze pedestrian trajectories. 

This repo is a port from the original `JPSreport` to a Python implementation, and will provide the same functionalities.

## Getting started
### Setup dependencies
For setting up your Python Environment a Python version >= 3.8 is recommended (our code is tested with 3.8).
To avoid conflicts with other libraries/applications the usage of virtual environments is recommended, see [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more detail.

Now the needed libraries for `PiTA` need to be installed.
You can use the provided `requirements.txt` to do so:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
The usage of the current state of the porting process can be seen in [demo notebook](usage.ipynb).
